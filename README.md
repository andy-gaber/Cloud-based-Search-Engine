The final group project for the course Internet and Web Systems at the University of Pennsylvania was a Java-based search engine developed without any framework and deployed on the cloud. 

It’s built from a custom HTTP server that supports static and dynamic content, in addition to HTTPS. The storage system is a distributed key-value store that uses consistent hashing for in-memory and persistent data. 
A distributed analytics engine that’s loosely based on Apache Spark to work with large data sets.
A web crawler and indexer that builds the inverted index.
The PageRank algorithm and additional features to rank web pages.
