This is the final group project for the course Internet and Web Systems at the University of Pennsylvania. A Java-based search engine developed without any framework and deployed on the cloud. 
It’s built from a custom HTTP server that supports static and dynamic content in addition to HTTPS.
A distributed key-value store — using consistent hashing with a coordinator and workers — is used as the storage system for in-memory and persistent data.
A distributed analytics engine that’s loosely based on Apache Spark to work with large data sets.
A web crawler and indexer that builds the inverted index.
The PageRank algorithm and additional features to rank web pages.
